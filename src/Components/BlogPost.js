      <h2>What I am Writing about</h2>
      <p>
        This is going to be a blog site about my journey becoming a Web
        Developer. I thank you for joining me for the ride and the many thoughts
        i will be putting down into the internet space.

        For a as long as I can remember I have always wanted to help people.
        This is in many different forms such as mentaly and physically. My
        calling started with me wanting to become a personal trainer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Things were going very well and I even had quite a few clients growing
        my business. Then one day 2020 happened and life through me a curveball.
      </p>
      <p>
        With covid, training people in their homes was out of the question and
        gyms had closed down so I had to find a new way to reach people. Hence
        my journey as a web developer began.
      </p>
      <p>
        Full disclosure, I have never been the most tech savy person on the
        planet. Not too long ago I could not even explane what a server was but
        the curosity was there to learn this vast space of development.
